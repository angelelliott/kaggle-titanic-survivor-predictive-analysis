This is my submission to the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" challenge from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/).
For this challenge, I built a logistic regression classifier to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.
I was given a dataset of passengers which include the following features: 
Passenger ID, ticket class, sex, age, number of siblings or spouse aboard the Titanic, number of children or parents abord the Titanic, ticket number,
passenger fare, cabin number, and port of embarkation.
